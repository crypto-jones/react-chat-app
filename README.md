## React-Chat-App

This is simple chat interface with real time chat functionality that uses the Chatkit API and database for user and post storage.

#### Tech Stack

React, Node, Express, Chatkit

#### To Run The App Locally

If you would like to run the app locally you will need to `npm install` separately in the `client` and `server` directories. You will also need to change the endpoints in `App.js` and `ChatScreen.js` in the `client` to match the `localhost:5000` server.

#### Chatkit

In addition, you will need to sign up with Chatkit (https://pusher.com/chatkit) and create your own credentials, including an `Instance Locator` and `Secret Key`, which will be required in `server.js`.

Lastly, you will need to create a new room under your Chatkit account and include the `Room ID` as well as your `Instance Locator` in `ChatScreen.js`.

#### App Features

- Choose your own username
- Online status for each user
- Who is typing indicator
- Timestamp on user posts

#### Additions To Come & More

In the future, I plan to make the app more user friendly by adding features such as:

- Login system
- Login with Github, Facebook, etc.
- Edit and delete posts functionality
- Update username
- Include a profile photo
- Include image, gif, video and other attachments
- Emoji integration
